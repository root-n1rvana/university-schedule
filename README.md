# Task 3.2 Bootstrap project



## Assignment

Create new Spring Boot project using [Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) with dependencies:
1. 
   - **Spring Web** (Build web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Apache Tomcat as the default embedded container.)
   - **Spring Data JPA** (Persist data in SQL stores with Java Persistence API using Spring Data and Hibernate.)
   - **Thymeleaf** (A modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments. Allows HTML to be correctly displayed in browsers and as static prototypes.)
   - **Flyway Migration** (Version control for your database so you can migrate from any version (incl. an empty database) to the latest version of the schema.)
   - **H2 Database** or **PostgreSQL** Driver of your choice
2. Create model and schema initalizing sql migration script according with your UML diagrama
3. Create JPA repositories and service layer with base CRUD operations


**Important:**

From now on you should cover all your code (repository, service) with test in case you add any logic like custom query or multiple repository/service calls in one method
